// Rules
// The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,

//  1. Render a grid [x]
//  2. Render a start button [x]
//  3. Seed a grid randomly when start button is clicked [x]
//  4. Implement each rule by TDD

// each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.

// Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are

// horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
