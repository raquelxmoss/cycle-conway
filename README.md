# [Conway's Game of Life in Cycle.js](http://raquelxmoss.github.io/cycle-conway)

This is a very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Cycle.js

My learning objectives were to:
  - Practise TDD
  - Improve my knowledge of testing in Javascript
  - Improve my understanding of building apps in Cycle.js
  - Use a new Observable from Rx.js

## TO DO
- Allow user to control probability
- Allow user to change the colour (because why the hell not)
- Allow user to change the border radius... idk
- Try implementing Cycle Animate
- Allow user to control speed
- Allow user to stop in time and go backwards and forwards
